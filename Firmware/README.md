OpenSegment Serial Display Firmware
==========================

The firmware for OpenSegment is located over on the [Serial7Segment repo](https://github.com/sparkfun/Serial7SegmentDisplay/tree/master/firmware/Serial%207-Segment%20Display/Serial_7_Segment_Display_Firmware). We combined the firmware for both Serial7Segment and OpenSegment because it's the same code with different pin assignments (to make the PCB layout easier).

If there are any improvements or modifications you'd like to make to the firmware, please create an issue over on the Serial7Segment [issues page](https://github.com/sparkfun/Serial7SegmentDisplay/issues?state=open).

The firmware for Serial7Segment and OpenSegment are based on the [SevSeg](https://github.com/sparkfun/SevSeg) library for Arduino, written by SparkFun.
